- Belief State Update in POMDPs
#### POMDPs
Compute and print out the belief state of the agent after performing $a_1$:n and observing $e_1$:n 
(i.e., observing each ei after performing the corresponding $a_i$ )

  Inputs <br/>
  • an initial belief state b(s) <br/>
  • a sequence of actions $a_1$:n <br/>
  • a sequence of observations $e_1$:n <br/>

  #### Approximate Reasoning in BNet:
  Estimate the probability of the event P(r|s,w) using sampling methods. <br/>

- Resolution in Propositional Logics
- WalkSAT <br/>
  Compute: <br/>
    • How many times WalkSAT terminates successfully for each of these sets of 50 problems <br/>
    • The median number of “flips” (i.e. steps) for each of these sets of 50 problems, considering only the cases when WalkSAT terminates successfully

### Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars
#### PCFG
Compute: <br/>
  • Estimates for the grammar probabilities based on silly-corpus <br/>
  • Given new grammar, compute the probability of the most likely parse for each of the following two sentences: *John plays soccer at school* and *John plays soccer*  <br/>
  • Compute the same two probabilities with the old grammar  <br/>
